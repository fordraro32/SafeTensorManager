if able use use NVIDIA Magnum IO Developer Environment docker for:
my usecase Generates large, complex programs (~10k lines of code).
Leverages 8 A100 GPUs for distributed processing.
Utilizes 2000 GB of memory for advanced memory management.
Does not alter the core LLM (Large Language Model) but enhances it using adapter layers and memory mechanisms.
The system should handle context and conversation history efficiently for long, coherent code generation.

for my llama 3.1 70b that in my folder as multiple .safetensor folder  
need you in first step Setup an Advanced Adapter ,

Step 1: Adapter Architecture
Adapters modify intermediate representations within a model by inserting small bottleneck layers that specialize in my task (code generation). They reduce the number of parameters that need to be trained while keeping the original model intact.

Adapter Architecture Design:
Layer Insertion:

Insert adapter layers between the transformer blocks of the model.
Use bottleneck layers to reduce the parameter size and computational overhead.
Bottleneck Size:

The bottleneck size is a key parameter. Use a small bottleneck size (e.g., 64 or 128) to reduce computational load while maintaining effectiveness.
Residual Connection:

Maintain a residual connection between the output of the original transformer layer and the adapter layer to ensure stability.

Step 2: Adding Adapters to Your Model
You can use the Hugging Face transformers library to easily add adapter layers to my chosen pre-trained model.

Load Pre-Trained Model:

Start with any large pre-trained model suitable for code generation, like GPT-3, GPT-Neo, or CodeT5.
Add Adapter Layers:

Use adapter-transformers (a variant of Hugging Face Transformers) to inject adapter layers into the model.

Train the Adapter:

Train the adapter layers on a code-specific dataset. This allows the model to specialize in generating complex and long-form code.

Step 3: Leveraging Memory for Context
To manage large context (like handling 10k lines of code), use memory in two ways:

Store conversation history to maintain coherence in code generation.
Cache intermediate outputs and offload less critical parts of the conversation to CPU memory.
Memory Management Strategy:
Persistent Memory Store:

Use Redis or in-memory databases to store large context windows.
Store important chunks of code that are reused or referenced frequently in memory.


Offloading Model States:

Offload model states, intermediate activations, and gradients to CPU RAM when they are not immediately needed to reduce GPU load.
Use DeepSpeed ZeRO to offload large models and enable memory-efficient distributed training.
Step 4: Multi-GPU Setup for Full Utilization
Initialize Multi-GPU Setup:

Use PyTorch Distributed to initialize multiple GPUs.
Ensure you use NCCL as the backend for efficient GPU communication.

Step 4: Multi-GPU Setup for Full Utilization
Initialize Multi-GPU Setup:

Use PyTorch Distributed to initialize multiple GPUs.
Ensure you use NCCL as the backend for efficient GPU communication.

Use model parallelism or data parallelism to split the computation across all 8 GPUs.


Gradient Offloading:

Leverage DeepSpeed to offload gradients and optimizer states to the CPU while running large models.


Summary
Adapter Tuning: Fine-tune smaller adapter layers to make the model more efficient at generating long, complex code.
Memory Utilization: Use your 2000 GB RAM for context storage, caching, and offloading model states to optimize performance.
Multi-GPU Utilization: Split workloads across your 8 A100 GPUs using distributed computing techniques like PyTorch Distributed and DeepSpeed ZeRO.
Backend System: Implement task scheduling, conversation handling, and efficient output validation to manage and refine the code generation process.
